            <ul>
              <li><strong>A/B testing</strong> – Also known as a “split test” or “bucket test”, A/B testing is an experimental method to examine the effect of on-page changes on user behavior. This is done by using two or more variants and randomizing it. The impressions from the variants (The Test Group) are measured in relation to the original page (The Control Group).</li>
              <li><strong>(Above the) Fold </strong>– The fold is the last visible point on the screen, prior to scrolling. When experiments are done below the fold, Twik only calculates exposures if the user scrolls to view it. When experimenting with landing pages, changes should be done above the fold to measure user response. However, Twik is also able to measure experiments which are done under the fold. Experiments are only measured as views if the user has scrolled to the exact location of the experiment.</li>
              <li><strong>Adaptive Multivariate Testing </strong>– As explained in the MVT term, the purpose of MVT is to reach the optimal combination of variants. Adaptive MVT differs in the sense that this process is done automatically by machine learning. This means that users do not need to speculate on variants’ success, but simply to insert as many variants as they would like, and let Twik decide what works best.</li>
              <li><strong>Bounce Rate</strong> – Bounce rate is the percentage of users that have only viewed one page before navigating away from the site. Personalization is meant to decrease this percentage by making uniquely customized information accessible to users. For more information on the topic, see pre-funnel targeting.</li>
              <li><strong>Call to Action</strong> – A call to action is usually a button or text that encourages the user to click it. It can be a special offer, a “learn more” link etc. Twik allows you to experiment with different call-to-actions to achieve the optimal conversion rate.</li>
              <li><strong>Click Through Rate (CTR)</strong> – Click through rate is the ratio between clicks and impressions, meaning, the percentage of people who were exposed to the link and clicked it.</li>
              <li><strong>Content Management System</strong> – A content management system, or CMS, is a platform which allows you to edit content on your page. Twik can operate as a CMS in some cases, especially when customizing pages per targeted audiences.</li>
              <li><strong>Conversion </strong>– Conversion is a name for a predefined action completed by the user. You can set the value of your conversion to be a form submission, a button click or a link click.</li>
              <li><strong>Conversion Rate</strong> – Conversion rate is the number of conversions on a page divided by the total number of visitors.</li>
              <li><strong>Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)</strong> – CRO is a process meant to increase conversion rates on a web page.</li>
              <li><strong>Experiment </strong>– An experiment is a test done on the webpage using variants, in order to reach a goal such as optimizing conversion or increasing user engagement.</li>
              <li><strong>Forced Group</strong> –  In adaptive MVT, the system combines all variants in all possible combinations to create the most converting page. But, sometimes variants only fit a certain set and are not to be mixed with other variants. That is the scenario when we need to create a forced group – a group that combines permanent variants with dynamic ones, allowing only variants from that group to participate in the MVT.</li>
              <li><strong>Funnel</strong> – A funnel is a set of actions that the website visitor must complete in order to reach a conversion.</li>
              <li><strong>Growth Hacking</strong> – Marketing can be done in a cost-effective and efficient way, and it’s called growth hacking. Find out all the guerilla marketing hacks with Twik.</li>
              <li><strong>Heatmap </strong>– A graphical representation of data such as clicks, scrolls and time spent on a page, which is meant to measure visitor behavior on web pages.</li>
              <li><strong>Interests </strong>– Twik is able to discern your visitors’ interests by tapping into their social networks. This is done by a-synchronic gated pixels request on niche social networks. Furthermore, Twik could tap into any login file/Jason from your website and adjust the targeting accordingly. Get ready for a deeply personal experience throughout your site.</li>
              <li><strong>Landing Page Optimization</strong> – Improving landing pages, in terms of content, design or links, in order to increase conversions or other goals.</li>
              <li><strong>Lead Generation</strong> – Creating interest amongst potential clients, and collecting contact details with the goal of turning it into sales.</li>
              <li><strong>Multivariate Testing (MVT)</strong> – MVT is a more complex form of testing that incorporates multiple variants and pages, and examines different variant combinations, in order to find the optimal and most conversion effective combination. The difference between MVT and A/B testing is that MVT is able to simultaneously test multiple variants on multiple pages. In this manner, MVT enables funnel optimization throughout websites.</li>
              <li><strong>On Page (Pages per session)</strong> – determine the page on which the experiment will show (the X page in a user’s session).</li>
              <li><strong>Pre-funnel Targeting</strong> – Recognizing anonymous users’ social networks and data in order to predict user interests in the website beforehand, creating a personalized experience.</li>
              <li><strong>Replace </strong>– Experiments can also become permanent once you choose the “replace” option.</li>
              <li><strong>Variant </strong>– Any element on the webpage can turn into a variant in an experiment. For example – text, image, link, form field or even a whole section.</li>
              <li><strong>Website optimization</strong> – Make your website convert at its best with the help of Twik experiments – change texts, images and links to ensure the best converting experience for each individual visitor.</li>
              <li><strong>Website personalization</strong> – Make your website completely customizable for each individual visitor. Use pre-funnel targeting and specially customized funnels, banners, and texts to make the visitor experience personal.</li>
              <li><strong>Weighted Funnel targeting</strong> – The ability to personalize a user’s journey by analyzing previously visited pages and deducing user interests.</li>
              <li><strong>Weighted Funnels (page views)</strong> – Define rules for a journey – pages that contain/start with/end with. Twik allows you to combine as many conditions as you would like, in order to get to the most specific targeting as possible.</li>
